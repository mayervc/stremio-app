## üß† Brief Description

Implement comprehensive splash screen with custom video player icon, red background, version display, and smooth animations. This PR creates a professional splash screen that matches the app's branding and provides an engaging user experience during app initialization.

---

## üí° Context / Background

**Requirements:**

- Display version of the app at the bottom
- Red background color matching app theme
- Custom video player/clapperboard icon in the center
- Smooth animations for enhanced user experience (bonus)

**Technical Approach:**

- Leveraged Expo's native splash screen configuration for optimal performance
- Created custom SVG-based icon component for scalability and crisp rendering
- Implemented React Native animations for smooth icon appearance
- Used Expo Constants for dynamic version display
- Configured proper splash screen lifecycle management

**Design Implementation:**
Based on the provided reference image, the splash screen features:

- Solid red background (#FF3B30) matching the app's primary color
- Centered white video player icon with clapperboard details
- Version text positioned at the bottom
- Smooth fade-in and scale animations for the icon

---

## üß™ How to Test

### Basic Functionality

1. **Launch the app** and verify the splash screen appears immediately
2. **Check version display** - should show "Version 1.0.1" at the bottom
3. **Verify red background** - entire screen should be solid red
4. **Confirm icon visibility** - white video player icon should be centered
5. **Test navigation** - app should navigate to main tabs after splash screen

### Animation Testing

1. **Fade animation** - icon should fade in smoothly over 800ms
2. **Scale animation** - icon should scale from 0.8 to 1.0 with spring physics
3. **Animation timing** - both animations should start simultaneously
4. **Performance** - animations should be smooth without frame drops

### Theme Consistency

1. **Color matching** - red background should match app's primary color (#FF3B30)
2. **Icon contrast** - white icon should be clearly visible against red background
3. **Text readability** - version text should be clearly readable

### Cross-Platform Testing

1. **iOS devices** - test on different iPhone models and iPad
2. **Android devices** - test on various Android screen sizes
3. **Orientation** - verify splash screen works in both portrait orientations
4. **Edge cases** - test with different system themes (light/dark)

### Performance Testing

1. **Load time** - splash screen should appear instantly
2. **Memory usage** - no memory leaks during splash screen display
3. **Battery impact** - animations should not significantly impact battery life
4. **Network conditions** - test with slow/fast network connections

## üßë‚Äçüíª Additional Notes

### Files Created/Modified

**New Files:**

- `app/splash.tsx` - Main splash screen component with animations
- `components/splash-icon.tsx` - Custom SVG video player icon component
- `assets/images/splash-icon.svg` - SVG source for the icon
- `scripts/generate-splash-icon.js` - Utility script for icon generation

**Modified Files:**

- `app.json` - Updated splash screen configuration with red background and version
- `package.json` - Added react-native-svg dependency

### Technical Implementation

**Splash Screen Configuration:**

```json
{
  "expo-splash-screen": {
    "image": "./assets/images/splash-icon.png",
    "imageWidth": 200,
    "resizeMode": "contain",
    "backgroundColor": "#FF3B30",
    "dark": {
      "backgroundColor": "#FF3B30"
    }
  }
}
```

**Animation Implementation:**

```typescript
// Fade and scale animations
const fadeAnim = useRef(new Animated.Value(0)).current
const scaleAnim = useRef(new Animated.Value(0.8)).current

Animated.parallel([
  Animated.timing(fadeAnim, {
    toValue: 1,
    duration: 800,
    useNativeDriver: true,
  }),
  Animated.spring(scaleAnim, {
    toValue: 1,
    tension: 50,
    friction: 7,
    useNativeDriver: true,
  }),
]).start()
```

**Version Display:**

```typescript
// Dynamic version from app.json
<Text style={styles.versionText}>
  Version {Constants.expoConfig?.version || '1.0.1'}
</Text>
```

### Dependencies Added

- **react-native-svg**: For custom icon rendering and scalability
- **expo-constants**: For accessing app version dynamically

### Design System Integration

**Color Consistency:**

- Background: `#FF3B30` (matches app's primary button color)
- Icon: `#FFFFFF` (white for maximum contrast)
- Text: `#FFFFFF` (white for readability)

**Typography:**

- Version text uses `Poppins_400Regular` font family
- Font size: 16px for optimal readability

**Animation Principles:**

- **Fade**: Smooth opacity transition for elegant appearance
- **Scale**: Spring physics for natural, bouncy feel
- **Duration**: 800ms for balance between smoothness and speed
- **Native Driver**: Hardware acceleration for optimal performance

### Performance Considerations

**Optimizations:**

- Native driver animations for 60fps performance
- SVG icons for crisp rendering at any resolution
- Minimal component tree for fast rendering
- Proper cleanup of animation references

**Memory Management:**

- useRef for animation values to prevent re-creation
- Proper dependency arrays in useEffect
- No memory leaks from animation listeners

### Accessibility

**Features:**

- High contrast design (white on red)
- Clear, readable version text
- Smooth animations that don't cause motion sickness
- Proper focus management after splash screen

### Future Enhancements

**Potential Improvements:**

1. **Loading Progress**: Add progress indicator for actual loading states
2. **Branding**: Add company logo or additional branding elements
3. **Localization**: Support multiple languages for version text
4. **Theme Support**: Dynamic splash screen based on device theme
5. **Custom Timing**: Configurable animation duration based on device performance

### Breaking Changes

- **None**: This is purely additive functionality
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing app functionality remains unchanged
- **No API Changes**: No impact on existing components or screens

### Rollout Considerations

**Deployment:**

- Safe to deploy immediately
- No feature flags required
- No database migrations needed
- No user impact on existing functionality

**Testing Priority:**

1. **High**: Animation performance on older devices
2. **High**: Cross-platform compatibility
3. **Medium**: Different screen sizes and orientations
4. **Low**: Edge cases with very slow devices

### Known Limitations

1. **Static Duration**: Animation timing is fixed (could be made configurable)
2. **Single Animation**: Only one animation type (could add more variants)
3. **PNG Dependency**: Still requires PNG file for Expo configuration
4. **Version Sync**: Version must be manually updated in app.json
